  <h2>PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION</h2>
  <div class="rounded">
    <p>The original edition of History and Doctrines of the Ājivikas is now nearly thirty years old , and for some years it has been out of print. In introducing this reprint I am acutely conscious of the long period which has elapsed since, as a lecturer at the School of Oriental and African Studies, London University, I completed the thesis on which the book is based . In that period many new texts have appeared in print, and much fresh work has been done on the age which saw the rise of the Ājivikas; hence it may be that a completely new edition of this book is required. Unfortunately I have been so deeply involved in other fields of teaching and research that I cannot myself under take such a task at present, and the demand for a reprinted edition grows, as interest in Indian religions and philosophy increases throughout the world . Thus I am compelled to allow the book to be published as it stands, without alteration .</p>
<p>I can, however, draw the reader&rsquo;s attention to significant reviews which put forward alternative interpretations and correct definite mistakes. These I list below :</p>
<p>Walther Schubring : ZDMG, civ. pp. 256-63 . The late Professor Schubring, with his unparallelled knowledge of the Jaina sources, here discusses and elucidates several very knotty points.</p>
<p>Helen M. Johnson, Journal of the Arnerican Oriental Society, lxxv, ( 1954 ) , pp. 63-65 . Corrects several minor errors and makes valuable suggestions.</p>
<p>D. Maskell, Philosophy xxxii ( 1957 ) , pp. 82-84. Makes valu able suggestions.</p>
<p>H. C. E. Zacharias, Anthropos xlviii , ( 1953 ) , pp. 323-24. Severely ( and perhaps justly ) criticizes my anthropological approach , which is ' Victorian ' . The late Professor Jayatilleke in his Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge, ( London , Allen &amp; Unwin , 1963 ) , criticized certain</p>
<p>of my interpretations rather forcibly. I am quite unconcerned and unrepentant, but the reader should be aware of these criticisms .</p>
<p>xvi PREFACE</p>
<p>One of the most serious attacks on my interpretation was made by Dr. B. Sitaraman ( “ Asuvika and Ajivikas ”, ed. S.Ritti and B. R. Gopal , Studies in Indian History and Culture ( Prof. P. B. Desai Felicitation Volume) Dharwar, 1971 , pp. 483-87 ) . Dr. Sitaraman maintains that the Acuvi-kācu ( or similar formula ) of the South Indian inscriptions was not a tax on Ājīvikas. This suggestion is not new , and is contraverted by considerable evidence , which I have dealt with on pp. 191 ff. below .</p>
<p>It is unfortunate that I am unable at this stage to provide a detailed examination of all these and other criticisms. Perhaps one day I shall be able to produce a completely new edition of this book, introducing new data and with many paragraphs rewritten . Meanwhile I can but hope that this reprint will be ofsome use to younger scholars throughout the world , wherever the history of Indian religious life is studied .</p>
<p>As an explanation of my methods I cannot do better than quote from the preface to the first edition :</p>
<p>“ In this study I have attempted, by a further examination of the better known sources, and by the use of material derived from sources hitherto untapped in this connection, to provide a more detailed and thorough study of Ajīvikism than has existed hitherto .</p>
<p>“ While I may claim to have added something to the work of Hoernle, Barua, and the other authorities, the account presented in this work, based mainly on the passin ? references of the Ājivikas' religious opponents, is inevitably fragmentary, and not always definite. To the lacunae in our knowledge must be added many uncertainties arising from contradictions in the sources themselves and from the imponderable but very real effect upon their authors of odium theologicum , which is usually clearly apparent, and which must often have led to exaggera tions, and perhaps to deliberately false statements. This being the case I have frequently been compelled to state my con clusions in hypothetical or provisional terms . The reader is asked to forgive the many occasions on which such irritating words and phrases as &quot; probably&quot; , &quot; possibly ” , “ perhaps” , “ it may be that &quot; , or &quot; we may tentatively conclude” , etc. , occur in the text. Such provisional conclusions are inevitable in the study of a subject such as this, and most Indologists would agree that they are better than no conclusions at all , or than categorical</p>
<p>PREFACE xvii</p>
<p>assertions based on inadequate evidence. Although in this and in other respects my picture of the rise, development, and decline of the Ājivika sect is still lamentably defective, I trust that my work will throw a little new light on an interesting and significant aspect of India&rsquo;s past, and will encourage further research .</p>
<p>“ I must ask the reader&rsquo;s indulgence for certain very specula tive paragraphs which have found their way into the final chapter. It is not for the research worker to usurp the privileges of the philosopher and theorize at length on the pattern of history. Nevertheless every facet of the world&rsquo;s history must stand in some relationship to every other and to the whole, and it seems to me to be legitimate, in a study of this character, that an effort should be made to establish such a relationship. Since history is not an exact science, any such attempt must inevitably be to some extent speculative. In the main body of my work I have attempted to keep firmly to my subject, and the digressions which from time to time occur , on such subjects as the age of a source, or the location of a town, should be found to have a significant bearing upon the main theme, or to be necessary for the full appreciation of its background . But ,</p>
<p>with the natural exuberance which arises with the knowledge of a long task nearing completion, I have allowed myself more latitude in the final chapter. The more speculative parts of that chapter, together with some passages of the introduction , I offer to the reader in the hope that they may stimulate him to further thought on the relation of religion and philosophy to sociology and politics. “ The more important passages from the sources have been translated or paraphrased in the course of the work. I have here and there allowed myself considerable liberty in transla tion, mainly with a view to rendering the passages in readable English , rather than in the Sanskritized style of a close trans lation . For the reader who wishes to refer to them I have included in footnotes the romanized originals of the most impor tant phrases of these passages , whether Sanskrit, Pali, Prakrit, or Tamil. I have usually broken up the longer compounds with hyphens, and as far as possible have simplified thejunction of words by the use of the apostrophe to mark a dropped vowel or one which has coalesced with that following, and of the circum flex accent to mark vowels long by sandhi. Except in this</p>
<p>xviii PREFACE</p>
<p>particular the system employed for the Sanskrit passages is orthodox . In those Pāli texts wherein n is used for anusvāra this sign has been regularly replaced by m; otherwise the trans literation of Päli passages is that of the Pali Text Society. In all transliterations, anusvāra, when occurring within the word before any of the twenty - five sparsa consonants, has usually been expressed by the appropriate nasal letter ; this, though it may offend some linguistic purists, is a common practice with modern Indian vernaculars, and avoids such ugly combinations as Mamkhali, amta , etc. In Tamil transliterations I have used the rule -of- thumb system of the Madras University Tamil Lexicon. This has normally been adhered to even in the case of Sanskrit words occurring in Tamil, and in the Sanskrit titles of Tamil works, wherever grantha characters are not used in the texts to express them - thus Civañānacittiyār appears in the place of the more usual hybrid form Sivajñāna-siddhiyār. Occa sional inconsistencies in these systems of transliteration , if found , are unintentional.</p>
<p>“ In the hope that this work may be of some interest to students of religion and philosophy who have no special knowledge of Ancient India, I have included in the index a few brief definitions of less familiar Indian terms used in the text.”</p>
<p>Of the scholars included in the acknowledgements of help in the first edition, five of the most important-Dr. L&hellip; D. Barnett, who supervised the original thesis, Mr. M. S. H. Thompson, who painstakingly guided me through the very difficult Tamil literary sources, Mr. C. A. Rylands and Dr. W. Stede, who taught me Sanskrit and Páli respectively, and Professor V. R. R. Dikshitar, who was instrumental in obtaining copies of South Indian Inscriptions , are , to my knowledge, dead. I remember them still , and also those still living who helped me, with affec tion and respect. I think particularly, in writing this preface, of my supervisor, Dr. L. D. Barnett. He was already in his 80s when this thesis was completed, but was still as intellectually alert as ever. This was the last thesis to be completed of the many that he supervised.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most important contribution that I have made to scholarship is indirect, in the work of the hundred or so research students whom I have supervised , wholly or partially, since completing my own thesis . Many of their theses have been</p>
<p>PREFACE xix</p>
<p>published, and are known wherever Indian history is studied, and many of my former students are now themselves widely recognized for their scholarship. For my success in helping so many young scholars I have nobody to thank but those young scholars themselves and Lionel David Barnett. It was his unfailing and evident interest in his students' progress, his willingness to spend time and trouble on them, his special care for the needs of his Indian students, writing in a language which was not their own, his careful checking of his students' note making and writing methods, which set the example which I have tried to follow . I hardly knew him personally. He never invited me to his home, and I never invited him to mine. At our weekly meetings we rarely discussed anything except the work in hand. Yet I felt that this old man genuinely cared for me, as I genuinely cared for him, and that if I were in serious trouble he would unfailingly do his best to help me. There were times when the problems involved in my research seemed too much for me, and I was inclined to give up in despair. My weekly meeting with Dr. Barnett invariably restored my confi dence. He had an aura about him ; a sincerity and repose emanated from him, which gave unfailing encouragement, a kind of psychological help as well as practical help in historical method and interpretation. I record this in order that this reprint of my book may help to keep alive the memory of a truly great man, to whom I , and many others with me, owe an incalculable debt .</p>
<p>In connexion with this Indian edition, I have to thank Mr. S.L.Jain ofMessrs Motilal Banarsidass, Delhi, for his initiative and enterprise, and also for his patience ; and Messrs Luzac</p>
<p>&amp; Co., London , and the School of Oriental and African Studies, London University, owners of the copyright of the first edition, for permitting the publication of this reprint.</p>
