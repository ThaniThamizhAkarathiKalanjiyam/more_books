FOREWORD 

It is gratifying to write a Foreword to History andDoctrines of theAjīvikas written by A.L. Basham . The book exhibits quite clearly the origin and development of the Ājīvikas sect in ancient India. In the sixth century B.C. in Magadha, three unorthodox sects developed almost in the same region. All these three sects were seeking satisfying explanations of the sacrifice and the Upanişadic gnosis. The doctrines of these three sects were propagated by Mahāvīra, Buddha and Gosāla. In course of time the doctrines of Mahāvīra and 

Buddha became famous and the doctrines of Gosāla past into the land of oblivion . Basham has restored this sect in his TheĀjīvikas. At the time of Mahāvīra, the Ājīvikas were powerful and Mahāvīra had to encounter with the views ofthe Ajīvikas . 

It is a fact worthnoting that the Ājīvika sect was very much alive till the Mauryan period and it was due to the patronage of Asoka, it reached its zenith . After that the Ajīvikas community dwindled rapidly in Northern India and soon became long -extinct. In South India, it , however, survived for a long period, perhaps, untill the 14th century A.D. Though A.W.F. Hoernley wrote an article on the Ajīvikas in the Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics (Vol. I) edited by Hastings, and Rockhill in the Life of Buddha, Appendix II , R.G. Bhandarkar and K.P. Pathak in the Indian Antiquary, Vol. XL, 1912, Basham's contribution to the subject is the best till now. 

Basham in his book The Ājīvikas has nicely delineated the history and the doctrines of the Ajīvikas and has restored quite authentically one of the vanished Indian religion . Every statement of Professor Basham is authenticated with lots of supporting documents culled from different fields of studies: 

literary, inscriptional , and even from the art pictures. A book like this has a perennial source of information . 

It is quite in the fitness of things that this book is being reprinted again for the benefit of the scholars, so that this lost religion is kept alive from generation to generation .
