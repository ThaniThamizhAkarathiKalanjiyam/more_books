THE PEREGRINATIONS OF THE Two ASCETICS 

Jinadāsa's cūrņī to the Āvaśyaka Sūtra contains a full account of Mahāvīra's early career , in the course of which are described the journeys which he made in the company of Gosāla . The author repeats the account of Gosāla's birth and early life, as given in the Bhagavatī .? He tells the story of the meeting of the two ascetics, and adds a significant incident which is said to have taken place just before Mahāvīra's final acceptance of Gosāla

as his associate. Gosāla, about to go on a begging expedition , asked Mahāvīra what alms he would receive that day. The latter 2 replied that, besides the usual alms of food, he would be given a counterfeit coin . The prophecy was fulfilled, and thus Gosāla decided that what was to be could not be otherwise.3 

After the two ascetics had departed together a further prophecy of Mahāvīra's greatly increased his belief in the power of Niyati. This was made at a village called Suvaņņakhalaya, and concerned the breaking of a pot of milk , the property of certain cow herds. Gosāla is said to have done his utmost to prevent the fulfilment of the prophecy. 

Then the two proceeded to Bambhanagāma, where Gosāla cu the house of Uvaņanda, a village headman , who refused him alms. His words, “ If my master has any ascetic power may this house burn ! ” were fulfilled immediately, not by virtue of his own asceticism , but by devas, desirous of vindicating Mahāvīra's fame.5 

The third rainy season of Mahāvīra's asceticism was spent at Campā in severe penance. After this the two visited a settle ment called Kālāya, where they sheltered for the night in an empty house which was resorted to by two lovers . In the dark ness the ascetics were not detected, until Gosāla's prurience betrayed him , and he was soundly beaten by the man . A similar incident occurred at another village called Pattakālaya.6 

At a settlement called Kumāraya Gosāla was involved in an altercation with a group of ascetic followers of Pārsva . He tried to destroy their settlement by the same process as that which he had employed on the house of Uvaņanda, but the superior virtue of the proto - Jaina ascetics prevented his curse from taking effect .? At another settlement called Coraga the two were suspected of being hostile spies and were thrown into a well, but were recognized by two female followers of Pārsva,

2 Or rather, according to Jinadāsa, the Vyantara god Siddhatthaka, who seems to have employed the meditating Mahāvīra as a medium on several occasions when he was addressed by Gosāla . 3 Jahā bhavitavvam ņa tam bhavaż annahā. Op. cit., p. 283. 4 Ibid ., loc. cit.

and were released. The second rainy season of their association was spent at Piţthicampā.1 

Thence the two proceeded to Katangala, and stopped in the meeting house of a settlement of daridda - theras, householder ascetics, with wives and families. It was a night of festival, during which the theras gathered for religious singing in their meeting house. The puritanical Gosāla roundly reproached them for their lax habits, and was thrown out into the cold of the winter night. Latecomers to the festival, sympathizing with his plight, brought him back into the hall, only for the process to be repeated twice more. At last the ascetics gave up attempting to exclude their censorious guest, and decided to put up with him for the sake of Mahāvīra, and to drown his protests with their drums. 

Outside the city of Sāvatthi Gosāla once more asked Mahāvīra to forecast the results of the day's begging expedition, and was told that he would receive human flesh. In the city a woman who had recently lost her child had been told by a fortune- teller that her next child would live if she gave some of the flesh of her dead child , mixed with rice, to a mendicant. Gosāla happened to be passing at the time, and received and ate the alms without knowing that they contained the human flesh prophesied by Mahāvīra. When he returned Mahāvīra asked him to vomit, and he realized that the prophecy had been fulfilled . As he could not again find the woman's house, in his anger he cursed the whole district by the same formula as before, and it was burnt to the ground. 

Near the village of Haledutā the ascetics spent the night in meditation under a tall tree. Merchants camping nearby started a fire, which spread through the undergrowth and approached their resting place. Shouting to Mahāvīra to follow him , Gosāla retreated, but the imperturbable Mahāvīra held his ground, although his feet were scorched by the flames. 4 

At the village of Mangala the two rested in the temple of Vāsudeva . Gosāla was irritated by the village children playing in the temple precincts, and angrily chased them away. For this display of bad temper he received a beating from the villagers.

44 HISTORY OF THE ĀJĪVIKAS 

A similar incident occurred in the temple of Baladeva at the village of Āvattā.1 

At a place called Corāya Gosāla, begging alone, was lured by the rich food which was being prepared for a festival. He was seen lurking in the vicinity of the festival pavilion, and was thought to be a spy sent by brigands. This resulted in another beating, after which Gosāla cursed the pavilion , which was promptly burnt to the ground.2 

At Lambuya the ascetics were seized by one of the village headmen, but were recognized and released . Thence they proceeded to Lādha ( W. Bengal), called in the text a non Āryan country. Here at the village of Punnakalasā they were attacked by two robbers, and were only saved by the intervention of the god Sakka, who killed their assailants. The fifth rainy season of Mahāvīra’s asceticism was spent at the city of Bhaddiyā.3 

At the village of Kadali, Gosāla, while begging alone, found an almsgiving ceremony in progress. He accepted much more rice than he could eat, and the villagers, disgusted at his greediness, poured what was left in his bowl over his head. The same treat ment was meted out to him at a village called Jambusanda. At Tambāya he was again involved in a quarrel with the followers of Pārsva. Then the two proceeded to Vesāli. On the way Gosāla violently upbraided Mahāvīra for refusing to come to his assistance when attacked . He decided that his lot would be easier if he travelled alone, and the two ascetics parted company. Soon after this Gosāla fell in with a band of 500 robbers, by whom he was mercilessly teased, carried pick - a -back ( ? ) , and called “ Grand father ” , 5 He then determined to rejoin Mahāvīra, since in his company he had always been freed from his persecutors by some pious person who recognized Mahāvīra's sanctity. He was left at last by the robbers, and after searching for six months found Mahāvīra, who was spending the sixth rainy season of his asceticism at the city of Bhaddiyā . 

The following year was spent in uneventful wanderings in Magadha, and theseventh rainy season was passed at Ālabhiyā.?

At Kundaga the two ascetics sheltered in the temple of Vāsudeva. Here Gosāla obscenely insulted the ikon, was seen by a villager, and was severely beaten. A similar event occurred at the village of Maddaņā, in a temple of Baladeva . ? 

At Lohaggala, described as the capital of King Jiyasattu, the couple were arrested as spies, but later identified and released . At Purimatāla they passed a bridal procession , and Gosāla received another beating for mocking the bride and bridegroom for their ugliness. Later at a place called Gobhūmi, he quarrelled with a company of cowherds, whom he called mlecchas, and was given the same treatment at their hands. The eighth rainy season was spent at Rayagaha.? 

In his ninth year of asceticism Mahāvīra decided to visit non Āryan countries, in order to invite persecution and thus to work off his karma. Accompanied by Gosāla he journeyed to Lādha and Vajjabhūmi (W. Bengal), where both were put to great ignominy by the uncouth inhabitants. There they spent the ninth rainy season.3 

In Mahāvīra's tenth year of wandering they left the non Āryan lands and went to Siddhatthagāma. Soon after this the incident of the sesamum plant occurred, which led to their final separation . This is described in full in the Bhagavatı Sūtra, and will be considered below. 

In another time and place Jinadāsa's terse Prākrit narrative would have been expanded by its author into a picaresque novel. In it Gosāla fills rather the rôle of a Sancho Panza than that of a Judas, for his misfortunes, while in part due to his loyalty to his master, and in part to his arrogance , are mainly the result of a lewd and surly clownishness, which can scarcely have been a significant element in the character of the founder of an important religious sect. The story as it stands is evidently fiction . 

Nevertheless it is of some value to the historian . The frame

The phrases Väsudeva padimãe adhitthānam muhe kaum thito,and tassa ( i.e. Baladevassa) muhe sāgāritam are obscure.

46 HISTORY OF THE ĀJĪVIKAS 

work of the account of Mahāvira's peregrinations is based on a very ancient tradition, for otherwise Lādha would not be described as a non- Aryan country. The visit of Mahāvīra to this district is confirmed by the early Ācāranga Sūtra . The Kalpa Sūtra confirms that Mahāvīra passed rainy seasons in the places specified by Jinadāsa,? with the exception of that spent in Lādha and Vajjabhūmi; this discrepancy is explained by the com mentator Vinayavijaya, who states that Paņiyabhūmi, where Mahāvīra is said by the Kalpa Sūtra to have spent a rainy season , is in Vajrabhūmi. Thus it is evident that Jinadāsa did not invent the whole of his story . 

In respect of the length of the period of the association of the two ascetics Jinadāsa's account differs from that of the Bhagavatī Sūtra. The latter source states that the two were associated for a period of six years . According to the former their meeting took place at the end of the second rainy reason of Mahāvīra’s asceticism , which was spent at Nālandā, and the two parted in the season of Sarada, after the ninth rainy reason . Theperiod of their association is thus seven years. We prefer, however, to accept the Bhagavatī's six years, as being found in the earlier and more reliable source . 

We suggest that the inspiration of many of the incidents of this story was obtained from Ājīvika legends about their founder, which were adapted by Jinadāsa to display Gosāla in a ludicrous light. The episode of the broken pot, which strengthened his faith in the power of destiny, reminds us that Buddhaghosa also wrote of the spilling of the contents of a pot at a crucial moment of Gosāla's career . We may believe that the Ājivikas had legends in which Gosāla was said to have called down fire from heaven upon his adversaries by the virtue of his austerities, and that these were utilized by Jinadāsa to provide further episodes of his story . 

It is significant that four of Gosāla's adventures are said to have taken place in Vaişņavite temples. Jinadāsa may indeed have been guilty of anachronism in these episodes, for it is by no means certain that temple worship and iconolatry had developed in India in the sixth century B.c. But the gods involved, Vāsudeva

MAKKHALI GOSĀLA AND HIS PREDECESSORS 47 and Baladeva, are among the earliest Vaişņavite divinities known to us. Vaişņavite tendencies are to be found in Ājīvika doctrine at a much later date, and Ājivikas are by one commentator explicitly identified with ekadandins, or Vaişņava ascetics .? 

The association of Gosāla with Vaişņavite temples and his expul sion from them may conceal an attempt of Jinadāsa to explain away a legend of the later Ājivikas in which their founder was depicted as breaking away from some more orthodox system . The same may be the case with the story of Gosāla and the daridda -theras, with whom he was allowed to remain on sufferance. These suggest the devotees of some Vaişņavite bhakti cult, and we have evidence that, like these, the Ājivikas employed music in their religious practice. 

Thus, although Jinadāsa gives us little reliable information about the life of Gosāla, it may be that he gives a few hints on what the Ājīvikas themselves believed about their master. 

GOSĀLA AND THE SESAMUM PLANT 

Still addressing his disciple Indabhūï Goyama, Mahāvīra is said by the Bhagavatī Sūtra to have told of two significant incidents which led to the separation of the two ascetics . 

During the season of Sarada the couple left the vihāra at the village of Siddhatthagāma, and set out for Kummāragāma. Neither of these places can be located, but we may assume that they were somewhere in Magadha. On the way to Kum māragāma they passed a flourishing sesamum shrub in full bloom. Looking at it, Gosāla asked Mahāvīra a question, apparently designed to test the latter's intuitive knowledge. 

“ Sir,” he asked, “ will this sesamum bush bear fruit or not, and what will become of these seven sesamum flowers ? ” A Mahāvīra replied that the shrub would develop, and that the

In the above paraphrase we take nipphajjissai to mean develop ” or “ bear fruit ” . This seems to make much better sense in the context than“ perish ” , the interpretation ofHoernle (ERE. I, p. 263 ), and Barua ( Pre-Buddhistic Indian Philosophy, p. 301 ) .

48 HISTORY OF THE ĀJĪVIKAS 

seven sesamum flowers would produce seven seed-pods in one cluster.1 

This very definite answer displeased Gosāla, and he determined to prove Mahāvīra a liar ; so he quietly dropped behind and pulled up the sesamum bush. But at that moment a shower of rain fell, the plant took root again , and so the flowers ripened and seven sesamum pods were produced in one cluster, just as Mahāvīra had prophesied. 

Soon afterwards the couple returned by the same road.3 As they drew near the spot where the sesamum plant grew Gosāla reminded Mahāvīra of his forecast, and declared that he would find that the plant had not ripened and the seeds had not formed . Mahāvīra, on the other hand, stood firm by his prophecy. He declared that he had been aware all the time of what Gosāla had done. The plant had been pulled up, and had temporarily died , but it had been reanimated by the shower and was once more living, while the seven pods had developed in the cluster. Plants , Mahāvīra added , were capable of paütta parihāra, or reanimation without transmigration.4 

Gosāla would still not believe Mahāvīra's word. But, on approaching the sesamum cluster, he found that it contained the seven seed -pods, just as Mahāvīra had prophesied. The revival of the sesamum plant made such an impression upon him that he became convinced that all living things were likewise capable of reanimation. And on this point he and Mahāvīra parted company, and their association came to an end. 

The strange story of Gosāla and the sesamum plant is possibly the adaptation of an Ājivika parable connected with a particular point of Gosāla's doctrine. The early Ājivikas may well have had a favourite simile resembling the story - that just as an uprooted 

1 Esa nam tilatthambhaë nipphajjissaï, no na -nipphajjissaï, vë ya satta tila puppha-jivā . . . egāë tila -sanguliyāë satta tilā paccāyāüssanti . Op. cit.,loc. cit. Inthis context the meaning of the word sangulikā , which I have translated " cluster " , is uncertain . Abhayadeva interprets it as phalikā seed - pod. Each sesamum flower produces a pod, and in this case seven pods would therefore be expected ; yet the text mentions only one sangulikā, which I therefore take to mean a cluster of pods or flowers. A single sesamum pod contains many more than seven seeds, and the satta tilā here seem to be not single seeds, but pods. According to Jiņadāsa's version of the story, the sesamum was replanted by the foot of a passing cow, sent by the devas. ( Āvaśyaka cūrni i , p. 297.) 3 Bh . Sū. xv, sû. 544 , fol. 666 .

MAKKHALI GOSĀLA AND HIS PREDECESSORS 49 

sesamum plant may revive after rain, so a dead body may, given certain favourable conditions, be reanimated . This was certainly part of the Ājīvika creed, and since its technical term , pautta- parihāra , is also used here in the story of the sesamum shrub, it would seem that the story and the theory are in some way connected . Thus the Jaina account in the Bhagavatī Sūtra may have been devised on the basis of the Ājīvika simile to dis credit the latter sect. On the other hand we have no other evidence that the Ājivikas used such a simile, and the possibility that the story has some basis of fact cannot be excluded . 

GOSĀLA AND VESIYĀYAŅA 

A further event which took place at the end of the period of Gosāla's association with Mahāvīra is also mentioned in the Bhagavatī Sūtra. The incident occurred on the journey to Kummāragāma, after Gosāla had uprooted the sesamum plant. As they proceeded on their way the couple met a foolish ascetic (bāla - tavassī) named Vesiyāyaṇa, outside the village of Kundag gāma ; he was seated on the ground facing the sun, with his arms raised above his head, and was engaged in a series of fasts, each of three days' duration. His body was covered with insects, born of the heat of the sun, and out of pity for all living things he would not interfere with them . Gosāla approached him and derisively asked him, “ Sir, are you a muni or a host for lice ? ” ( jāyā -sejjayaraë). Vesiyāyaṇa did not reply, and Gosāla twice repeated the same question. After the third insult Vesiyāyaṇa's wrath was thoroughly aroused. In order to encompass Gosāla's destruction he stepped back seven or eight paces and released against him the magical heat which he had accumulated by his asceticism. But Mahāvīra, taking pity , on his companion, counteracted the attack by releasing a flow of cooling magical power ( sīyaliyam teyalessam ). When Vesiyāyaṇa saw that Gosāla was in no way injured by his attack he was pacified, and recognized Mahāvīra's superior psychic power. 

After Mahāvīra had explained to Gosāla what had happened the latter, filled with terror and awe at his colleague's miracle , did him homage, and asked how he too might obtain similar 1 V. supra , p. 31 . 2 Bh. Sū. xv, «ū . 543, fol. 665-6 .
